These are some core concepts in Flux.

## GitOps

GitOps is a way of managing your infrastructure and applications so that whole system
is described declaratively and version controlled (most likely in a Git repository),
and having an automated process that ensures that the deployed environment
matches the state specified in a repository.

For more information, take a look at ["What is GitOps?"](https://www.gitops.tech/#what-is-gitops).

## Sources

A *Source* defines the origin of a repository containing the desired state of 
the system and the requirements to obtain it (e.g. credentials, version selectors). 
For example, the latest `1.x` tag available from a Git repository over SSH.

Sources produce an artifact that is consumed by other Flux components to perform
actions, like applying the contents of the artifact on the cluster. A source
may be shared by multiple consumers to deduplicate configuration and/or storage.

The origin of the source is checked for changes on a defined interval, if
there is a newer version available that matches the criteria, a new artifact
is produced.

All sources are specified as Custom Resources in a Kubernetes cluster, examples
of sources are `GitRepository`, `HelmRepository` and `Bucket` resources. 

For more information, take a look at
[the source controller documentation](components/source/_index.md).

## Reconciliation

Reconciliation refers to ensuring that a given state (e.g. application running in the cluster, infrastructure)
matches a desired state declaratively defined somewhere (e.g. a Git repository).

There are various examples of these in Flux:

- `HelmRelease` reconciliation: ensures the state of the Helm release matches what is defined in the resource,
  performs a release if this is not the case (including revision changes of a HelmChart resource).
- `Bucket` reconciliation: downloads and archives the contents of the declared bucket on a given
  interval and stores this as an artifact, records the observed revision of the artifact
  and the artifact itself in the status of resource.
- `Kustomization` reconciliation: ensures the state of the application
  deployed on a cluster matches the resources defined in a Git repository or S3 bucket.

## Kustomization

The `Kustomization` custom resource represents a local set of Kubernetes resources
(e.g. kustomize overlay) that Flux is supposed to reconcile in the cluster.
The reconciliation runs every one minute by default, but this can be changed with `.spec.interval`.
If you make any changes to the cluster using `kubectl edit/patch/delete`,
they will be promptly reverted. You either suspend the reconciliation or push your changes to a Git repository.

For more information, take a look at the [Kustomize FAQ](faq.md#kustomize-questions)
and the [Kustomization CRD](components/kustomize/kustomization.md).

## Bootstrap

The process of installing the Flux components in a GitOps manner is called a bootstrap.
The manifests are applied to the cluster, a `GitRepository` and `Kustomization`
are created for the Flux components, then the manifests are pushed to an existing Git repository
(or a new one is created). Flux can manage itself just as it manages other resources.
The bootstrap is done using the `flux` CLI or
using our [Terraform Provider](https://github.com/fluxcd/terraform-provider-flux).

For more information, take a look at [the bootstrap documentation](installation/_index.md#bootstrap).
