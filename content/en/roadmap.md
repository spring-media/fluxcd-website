# Flux Roadmap

{{% alert color="info" title="Production readiness" %}}
The Flux custom resource definitions which are at `v1beta1`, `v1beta2` and `v2beta1`
and their controllers are considered stable and production ready.
Going forward, breaking changes to the beta CRDs will be accompanied by a conversion mechanism.
Please see the [Migration and Support Timetable](docs/installation/migration/timetable.md) for our commitment to end users.
{{% /alert %}}

The following components are considered production ready:

- [source-controller](docs/components/source)
- [kustomize-controller](docs/components/kustomize)
- [notification-controller](docs/components/notification)
- [helm-controller](docs/components/helm)
- [image-reflector-controller](docs/components/image)
- [image-automation-controller](docs/components/image)

The following GitOps Toolkit APIs are considered production ready:

- `source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`
- `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`
- `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1`
- `helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1`
- `image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1`

## The road to Flux v2 GA

In our planning discussions we have identified these possible areas of work,
this list is subject to change while we gather feedback:

- Stabilize the image automation APIs
    - [x] Review the spec of `ImageRepository`, `ImagePolicy` and `ImageUpdateAutomation`
    - [x] Promote the image automation APIs to `v1beta1`

- Conformance testing
    - [x] End-to-end testing for Flux bootstrap on AMD64 and ARM64 clusters
    - [x] End-to-end testing for Flux image automation

- Adopt Kubernetes server-side apply ([fluxcd/flux2#1889](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/1889))
    - [x] Replace `kubectl` usage in Flux CLI with server-side apply
    - [x] Rewrite the kustomize-controller reconciler using server-side apply

- Multi-tenancy lockdown
    - [x] [Allow setting a default service account for impersonation](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/2340)
    - [x] [Allow disabling cross-namespace references](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/2337)
    - [x] [Document multi-tenancy lockdown configuration](docs/installation.md#multi-tenancy-lockdown)

- API consolidation ([fluxcd/flux2#1601](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/1601))
    - [ ] Adopt Kubernetes [kstatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/tree/v0.25.0/pkg/kstatus#conditions) standard conditions
    - [ ] Standardize events and status conditions metadata

- Documentation improvements
    - [x] Consolidate the docs under [fluxcd.io](https://fluxcd.io) website
    - [x] Gather feedback on the [migration guides](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/413) and address more use-cases
    - [ ] Incident management and troubleshooting guides
    - [ ] Developer guides for contributing to and extending Flux
    - [ ] Cloud specific guides (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, more?)

## Security enhancements

Reach consensus on multi-tenancy enhancements and other security related proposals:

- [x] [RFC-0001](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/pull/2212) Memorandum on the authorization model
- [ ] [RFC-0002](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/pull/2092) Access control for cross-namespace source references
- [ ] [RFC-0003](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/pull/2093) Flux Multi-Tenancy Security Profile
- [ ] [RFC-0004](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/pull/2086) Define Flux tenancy models

## The road to Flux v1 feature parity

In our planning discussions we identified three areas of work:

- [x] Feature parity with Flux v1 in read-only mode
- [x] Feature parity with the image-update functionality in Flux v1
- [x] Feature parity with Helm Operator v1

### Flux read-only feature parity

Flux v2 read-only is ready to try. See the [Getting
Started](/docs/get-started/) how-to, and the
[Migration
guide](/docs/installation/migration/flux-v1-migration/).

This would be the first stepping stone: we want Flux v2 to be on-par with today's Flux in
[read-only mode](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/blob/master/docs/faq.md#can-i-run-flux-with-readonly-git-access)
and [FluxCloud](https://github.com/justinbarrick/fluxcloud) notifications.

Goals

State | Item
----- | ----
:heavy_check_mark: | [Offer a migration guide for those that are using Flux in read-only mode to synchronize plain manifests](/docs/installation/migration/flux-v1-migration/)
:heavy_check_mark: | [Offer a migration guide for those that are using Flux in read-only mode to synchronize Kustomize overlays](/docs/installation/migration/flux-v1-migration/)
:heavy_check_mark: | [Offer a dedicated component for forwarding events to external messaging platforms](/docs/operations/notifications/)

Non-Goals

guide](/docs/workflows/image-update/) for how to
install and use it.

### Helm v3 feature parity

Helm support in Flux v2 is ready to try. See the [Helm controller
guide](/docs/workflows/helmreleases/), and the [Helm
controller migration
guide](/docs/installation/migration/helm-operator-migration/).
